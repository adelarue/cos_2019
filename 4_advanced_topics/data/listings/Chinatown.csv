The machines will only take a special laundry card (which will be provided during your stay). You can easily add value to the laundry card at self-serve stations in the laundromat. Gym: The YMCA is located 3 blocks away from the apartment. They have a lap pool, basketball court, exercise classes and of course all the other typical gym stuff like weights and machines. If you're already a member of the YMCA elsewhere, you should be able to go there for free. If you're not a member, a day pass currently costs $15. Monthly rates vary but are around $50. There's also a Boston Sports Club in the South End that's about a 15 min walk away. It's very nice but definitely more expensive. Local Construction: There is construction ongoing across the street. The work generally occurs only during the day and only on weekdays. It is typically not too loud o","Walking: The apartment is walking distance from just about everything in downtown Boston. Just remember to bring shoes you are comfortable walking in!  Public Transportation: The apartment is within walking distance of the subway, commuter rail and buses.

Other nearby subway stations include: -South Station (Red line, Silver line, commuter rail): 10-15 min walk -Downtown Crossing Station (Red line and Orange line): 10-15 min walk -Boylston Station (Green line): 10-15 min walk Driving: The good news about driving around here: the apartment is ideally located right where I-93 and I-90 meet, so it's pretty easy to hop right onto either highway. Also, since pretty much everything is close by, you won't have to spend too much time in the car (or on your cab fare). The bad news about driving around here: the apartment is in Boston.

The machines will only take a special laundry card (which will be provided during your stay). You can easily add value to the laundry card at self-serve stations in the laundromat. Gym: The YMCA is located 3 blocks away from the apartment. They have a lap pool, basketball court, exercise classes and of course all the other typical gym stuff like weights and machines. If you're already a member of the YMCA elsewhere, you should be able to go there for free. If you're not a member, a day pass currently costs $15. Monthly rates vary but are around $50. There's also a Boston Sports Club in the South End that's about a 15 min walk away. It's very nice but definitely more expensive. Local Construction: There is ongoing construction across the street from the apartment. The work generally occurs only during the day and only on weekdays.

Public Transportation: The apartment is within walking distance of the subway, commuter rail and buses.

Other nearby subway stations include: -South Station (Red line, Silver line, commuter rail): 10-15 min walk -Downtown Crossing Station (Red line and Orange line): 10-15 min walk -Boylston Station (Green line): 10-15 min walk Driving: The good news about driving around here: the apartment is ideally located right where I-93 and I-90 meet, so it's pretty easy to hop right onto either highway. Also, since pretty much everything is close by, you won't have to spend too much time in the car (or on your cab fare). The bad news about driving around here: the apartment is in Boston.
