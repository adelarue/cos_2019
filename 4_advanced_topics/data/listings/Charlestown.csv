I was born in Charlestown. Lived on Bunker Hill Street till I was three years old. Moved to another section of the city known as West Roxbury, where I grew up. Have been back here at 39 Green Street since 2000. This house was the home to Michael and Emily O'Brien(,Cork and Kilarney) my mother's(Rita) parents. I've been to Europe on two different occassions and visited, Berlin, Paris, Amsterdamn, and Naples, in Italy, the birthpace of my fathers'(Blasé) parents, Maria and Giaccommo. I enjoy hosting travellers form all over the world. It's intersting, educational and I receive great pleasure from meeting and conversing with all the different people. I enjoy creative writing, reading, movies and many artistic endeavors.  Love the Red Sox and the other Boston sports teams. Love Italian food.. Don't be afraid to share.

You must try a duck tour.  They go all through the city and talk about the history and cool fact about Boston.  Highly recommend.  2.) The freedom trail is a trail through Boston (Easy to follow with bricks the stand out) that takes you through the best parts of the city with cool stops along the way. 3.) Faneuil Hall.  Great place to check-out, shop, eat.  A lot of really nice restaurants there as well as being very close to the water and the harbor walk which is a walk along Boston harbor that I find beautiful.  Also many parks around there as well such as the greenway and Christopher Columbus Park 4.)  Fenway Park.  If you are big baseball fans you have to check out Fenway Park and the surrounding area.  Definitely a pleasure to see. 5.)  If you love shopping check out Newbury Street.  Bostons best shops are located her","Parking and Transportation Luckily the parking situation at my condo is very good for Boston.  Charlestown is free to park anywhere on weekends and holidays, but there is a street very close that it is okay to park always (On weekends its easy to park usually right in front of my place).  I cannot say enough how rare this is for Boston.  The name of this street is called Terminal St and is located very close to my place.  I can show you when you arrive if you'd like.  Boston however is not a driving city.  It is very difficult really see the cool things in Boston and drive to them.  For this I suggest using Uber.  It is very cheap to get all around the city.  If you have not signed up for it yet you can use my referral code and get some free rides around the city.
