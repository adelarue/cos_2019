Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

In late February, I started working full-time in the Boston office of Fasten with the official recruitment team. I recruit drivers, sign them up, handle their applications, and help improve the driver/rider experience.

I used to help at Pinch! App. With a team, I helped conduct market research, recruit pinch pros, and recruit Lyft drivers to promote the app.

Most recently, I was living in Tulsa, OK and working as a personal assistant/ driver. I called my services Cloudride. In Tulsa, I rented my cars on Turo  (I still do this), taught 2nd grade for Teach for America, drove for Lyft, and delivered for Midnight Grill Delivery. 

I am a dabbler and have my hands in different markets. I am not a typical 23 year old. I spend most of my time networking and talking/learning from others about tech start ups, finance, and self sufficiency.

I grew up in Guatemala City, Guatemala and Anderson, South Carolina. I am fluent in Spanish and learned to speak English when I was nine. 

 I attended the number one ranked residential two-year college in the country, Spartanburg Methodist College. I graduated number one in my class with an associates in liberal arts. Afterwards, I transferred to the best all women's college in South Carolina, Converse College and graduated top 10 with a B.A. in Philosophy.

I am absolutely obsessed with the economical idea of a shareconomy (peer to peer access to goods and services.) My interests are centered around apps that focus on logistics.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.

I went to elementary, high school and university in this incredible city. My boyfriend, Jason, grew up in Hong Kong and came to Boston for college. He and I travel internationally for several months durng the year, but always come back to this city for its incredible food, fun atmosphere, and because it's our home.  We live in the 'burbs (about 15 minutes away) with our Siberian Husky.

The two of us have grown up traveling. We've experienced five-star accommodations from our previous ""business"" careers in management consulting and accounting. We have also traveled through the Jordanian desert sleeping in Bedouin tents and with Northern Thailand families in bamboo huts. The common denominator that we feel makes a wonderful accommodation is when a home-y and comfortable space.  We've designed the apartment with this in mind. All ceramic pottery pieces were designed by my Aunt Sally. All framed prints and canvases were photographed by Jason or myself. 

When traveling, our main focus is always food. We love our meats and seafood.  The one thing that makes my eyes pop is dessert. Jason is all about his red wine, scotch and other classic drinks.  Our second focus is the local experience. There is so much more to a city than historical buildings, duck  boat tours, and the Freedom trail (all of which are amazing).  There are the North End side streets for delicious lobster rolls, local markets (like the South End SOWA), and really interesting one-day volunteer opportunities.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.
