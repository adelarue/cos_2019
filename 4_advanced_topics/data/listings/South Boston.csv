We are known for our distinctively furnished apartments in popular locations, and for our attentive service. You’ll find that our rates are quite reasonable. If you're looking for a safe, comfortable place with fabulous amenities and Wi-Fi (we know you need the Wi-Fi!) in the Boston MA area, Washington DC, Miami FL or very close to NYC in Jersey City or Hoboken, we'd love to host you. Many of the buildings where our apartments are located feature amenities such as beautiful lobbies, 24 hour front desk staff, fitness centers, business centers, recreation rooms, indoor or outdoor pools and whirlpools. If you are traveling with children, some buildings offer playgrounds (many buildings are near public playgrounds as well) or indoor playrooms. Depending on the location, you can stay for just a few days, a week, a month or more. 

We offer an assortment of short-term apartments in sizes ranging from a studio to three bedrooms that are fully furnished with all the comforts of home. Our local staff meticulously prepares your apartment before your arrival, and we offer 24 hour assistance for any emergencies after business hours. When you arrive at your apartment, the beds will be made, towels and bath amenities will be stocked in the bathrooms, and the coffee maker will be set up in the kitchen with some sample coffees, sweetener and creamer (teabags too if that is your preference) to start your morning off properly. If you’d like to cook a meal, the kitchen is stocked with dishes, cutlery, glassware and pots and pans. The living room is set up with a TV and cable channels, and the Wi-Fi router password and instructions will be prominently displayed so you can get connected quickly. You can also make local and toll-free phone calls at no charge.

My name is Sarah, I was born in Morocco and have been a Bostonian for the past seven years. Prior to date, I lived and studied in France for seven years.

My childhood in Morocco taught me Arabic, French, empathy, respect, resourcefulness, flexibility and quick problem solving skills.

My parents gave me their thirst for learning and continuous improvement, their professionalism, work ethic and dedication.

My seven years in France sharpened my taste in European pastry, Caribbean music and fed my general knowledge.

My seven years so far in the US awakened my passion for running and thrift shopping.

Now ? I am :

- making my way in the fascinating world of Non Profit Project Management.
- running 10k every two days.
- learning Spanish.
- reading every book I can find by Marcel Rufin.
- watching religiously Suits every Thursday and Ballers every Sunday.

My husband and I have been using Airbnb as guests for the past 2 years and started hosting ourselves on August 2015. We are multilingual, curious about every other culture and traveling is basically a second nature (as much as an addiction).

Looking forward to meet you as guest or host (or who knows, maybe both).

Warm regards,

Sarah.

We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

The #9 bus stops at the top of H Street and East Broadway and will take you right into the South End neighborhood and Back Bay, both of which are very popular. Before it brings you to these areas though, it will stop at the Broadway T station where you can get on the redline subway and go wherever you'd like via train! It's a 1 mile walk to the Broadway T station if you prefer, and an additional 15 minutes into the South End.  The #7 bus stops at the corner of East Broadway and L street (about a 5 minute walk from the apartment) and it will take you through the Fort Point Channel/Seaport District and into Downtown Crossing and the Financial District downtown. Walking to Downtown Crossing will take you about 35 minutes if you prefer to walk.
