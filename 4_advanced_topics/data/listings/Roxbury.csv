I'm in a long term gay relationship with my partner who also lives at this listing.  He is a full time human resources professional and very easy to get along with.  At times we would both be here and other times not, depending on our travel plans.  
Personnaly, I'm retired for the most part and spend my winters in Florida or the Caribbean, summers in Provincetown, Cape Cod, Massachusetts and the rest of my time in Boston.  My professional career started as a house painter and then bartender and ended in real estate and construction, my fun and passion.  I've traveled Europe a number of times and lots of time in Costa Rica, Panama and a few other Caribbean countries.  I hope to one day soon to have a return visit to Cuba!! I speak a little Spanish but can understand it more.  I love to immerse myself in the local culture during my travels.  I've never been on a cruise but I have done one ""all inclusive"" resort to attend a destination wedding.  It was more fun than I expected it would be : )

I've lived here two years, and have never felt unsafe, and I love my neighbors and everyone I meet. However, you will see occasional things such as: run down buildings, graffiti, homeless people on the main street, Melena Cass, and you will hear things occasionally such as: sirens, because of the close proximity of the hospital, a lady that likes to walk around during the day preaching the word of God through a bull-horn, loud music from the cars stopped at the traffic light out front, people occasionally yelling at each other outside. Also, it is an old house so it is easy to hear the front door opening and closing, people going up and down the stairs, the neighbors if they are in the backyard, and my upstairs neighbor when she vacuums or occasionally hammers god-knows-what upstairs at 11:30pm. Most weekday nights it is extremely quiet as there is","Please remember that I am a single mom, and that this is home sharing! Think of it more as...staying with a friend...and not in a hotel. :) I will keep the place picked up, but just note that there may be stacks of books, kids toys, and occasional other things around. **The Shower** Because this is an old building and I share pipes, the shower can be very finicky. If someone else in the building accesses the water while you are in the shower, the shower will lose water pressure and become VERY hot. When this happens you can step back for a moment until it changes back, or turn the water down, in which case you will have to turn it back up once the temperature adjusts back, and the water turns cold. I have learned how to finagle this, and can hear the change coming, but I wanted to give potential guests a heads up as it can be slightly annoying and inconvenient. I have two indoor only cats in the house, so if you have allergies or dislike animals, this is probably not the place for you.","Ideal commuter location! I-95 is right up the road. Silver Line T Stop Melnea Cass @ Washington is a block away. Orange line T Stop Ruggles is a 15 minute walk. Multiple bus stops one block away, and Dudley Station is around the corner.

However, what I adore about it seems to be the same attributes that make others uncomfortable or feel unsafe.  We live in an area of Boston known as Dorchester, specifically on the border of the Egleston Square section of Jamaica Plain.  This is a residential part of Boston that has been largely neglected by the city and overall development.  Therefore, the buildings are older, many sad and vacant.  The upside of this is that lower-income families are able to afford these homes and so we have a lot of kids and families in the area.  There is also a branch of the Boston Public Library two blocks away!  Franklin Park, one of the famous nature areas of Boston is visible from the corner of our street, and directly diagonal from the bus stop.  This is a great place to go for walks or get a run in in the early mornings (I've even seen people cross-country skiing when there is snow on the ground)!  A number of Bodegas are also within easy","We are a family of two, myself and a 9 year old, if you are not good with kids we may not be the best place to stay.  While very well behaved the child LOVES visitors and will quickly make you his best friend and drill you on your knowledge of comic books, Pokemon, Clash of Clan, Minecraft, and whatever else attracts his attention.  However, do not feel bad about telling him you'd rather not interact and he is very good about respecting your space.","To get to our home you can either walk up a hill about 15 minutes from the Stoneybrooke train station or take a bus from the Ruggles (22, 29, or 44), Roxbury Crossing (22 or 29), or Jackson Sq (22, 29, or 44) train stations (all on the orange line).  The bus stop is called Walnut St and is part of the Egleston Square area.  When taking the train and bus (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps can provide good guidance but I usually allow a minimum of 45 minutes to get anywhere, with an extra 10 minutes per transfer needed. If you prefer to see the city a bit more up close Hubway is the city's bike share system.  We have a station about 10 minutes from our house and while a deposit of $101 is required a day pass is only $6 and gets you unlimited 30 minute rides for 24 hours. We like Boston Cab for taxi services.  If you do require a cab it is best to call the dispatcher and request one as our area is not popular with cab drivers.","We do our very best to welcome all guests personally, however if this is not possible we will arrange a way to get you your set of keys.  All guests have access to the entire apartment (save our private rooms) including a washer and dryer in the basement.  This washer and dryer is shared however, and access is limited during the week when the other tenants have use of the machines.",Please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable.

Thank you for checking out my profile! 
I am a relatively new member at airbnb and could not be more excited about this new journey in my life - having spent the last 20 years in the fascinating world of finance - I could not be more open to a change in scenery. Although I love finance - meeting and hosting people from all over the world has an extraordinary appeal to me. I raised six children - yours, mine and ours. They range from ages 19 through 24 - a true Brady Bunch - 3 girls and 3 boys. All of them are doing wonderful things and have moved to school, serving in the military or have started their own family. Like a significant amount of ""middle aged,"" folks I am not only an empty nester - but have recently become single and am rediscovering myself and life. What a fascinating journey that is. One of the big steps that I took was to move into the city - my motivation for the move was that I thought it would be a lot more fun than living in the suburbs. I was correct. There is never a dull moment in the city! The people watching is captivating - the culture is bright, enthusiastic and alive with a feeling of constant rebirth - students moving in, moving out, medical professionals coming in and then moving on, business professionals attending conventions and tourists visiting our fine city and then returning home - It is truly a magical place and there is no where that I would rather be - well...ok - maybe I would like to be in Namibia, South Africa.

Right at the subway station outside you'll see these bikes and the station is located on Boston's longest bike and walking path, the Southwest Corridor Park. 10 mins to back bay, 25 mins to Harvard Square.
