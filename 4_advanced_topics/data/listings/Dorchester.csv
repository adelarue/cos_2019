I'm from Dublin, Ireland and moved to Boston 6 years ago. 

Loved to travel around Europe and always enjoyed the hostels we stayed in! After moving to the states I have tended to remain up here in the North East, travelling around Massachusetts to New Hampshire up to Canada - generally on the hunt for good skiing.

While in Boston I try to balance things out between working away as a code monkey and trying to pull together a startup. With a few hours still going to waste, I've gone back to school with evening classes up in Harvard Extension. 

I love having friends over - I'll throw together some random event, be it Johnny Appleseed Cider Fest or a Spaceballs movie night. Something to get friends together.
