Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That's what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. 
Just like all of the travelers that I've hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you're looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. 
Speaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it's just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!
What keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them. These notes always put a smile on my face and leave me knowing that I have made someone's visit memorable!",within an hour,100%,100%,FALSE,https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/324630/profile_pic/1329710028/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/324630/profile_pic/1329710028/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Mission Hill,7,7,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio']",TRUE,TRUE,"boylston st., Boston, MA 02215, United States",Fenway,Fenway,NA,Boston,MA,02215,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.3462145727819,-71.09372008506031,TRUE,Apartment,Entire home/apt,4,1,0,1,Real Bed,"{Internet,""Wireless Internet"",""Air Conditioning"",Kitchen,""Elevator in Building"",""Buzzer/Wireless Intercom"",Heating,""Family/Kid Friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke Detector"",""Carbon Monoxide Detector"",Essentials,Hangers,""Hair Dryer"",Iron}",NA,$99.00,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,$0.00,1,30,today,NA,1,3,18,283,2016-09-06,184,2014-09-06,2016-08-19,76,8,7,8,9,9,8,FALSE,NA,NA,TRUE,flexible,FALSE,FALSE,7,7.53

Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That's what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. 
Just like all of the travelers that I've hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you're looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. 
Speaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it's just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!
What keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them.

Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That's what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. 
Just like all of the travelers that I've hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you're looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. 
Speaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it's just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!
What keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them. These notes always put a smile on my face and leave me knowing that I have made someone's visit memorable!",within an hour,100%,100%,FALSE,https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/324630/profile_pic/1329710028/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/324630/profile_pic/1329710028/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Mission Hill,7,7,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio']",TRUE,TRUE,"Boylston Street, Boston, MA 02215, United States",Fenway,Fenway,NA,Boston,MA,02215,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.34569073544391,-71.09326627246774,TRUE,Apartment,Entire home/apt,3,1,0,1,Real Bed,"{Internet,""Wireless Internet"",""Air Conditioning"",Kitchen,""Elevator in Building"",""Buzzer/Wireless Intercom"",Heating,""Family/Kid Friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke Detector"",""Carbon Monoxide Detector"",Essentials,Shampoo,""24-Hour Check-in"",Hangers,""Hair Dryer"",Iron,""Laptop Friendly Workspace""}",NA,$99.00,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,$0.00,1,45,today,NA,1,3,14,284,2016-09-06,71,2015-09-23,2016-08-21,79,9,7,8,9,9,8,FALSE,NA,NA,TRUE,flexible,FALSE,FALSE,7,6.07

The apartment windows face an alley so there is not a ton of direct sun light during the day.  Also, there is a heavy gate that residents use to get into the building that can be loud when it slams shut.  This has never been a problem for me at night time, as the door is rarely used late at night.  The TV is great, but I have chosen not to subscribe to cable.  One burner on the stove is slightly tilted which can be annoying, but it works perfectly fine.

I like to refer to myself as a retired elementary teacher although I spent the last quarter of my career as an administrator.  But my teaching years were my best.  The daily student teacher interaction, the laughter and frustrations, the little signs of progress, made the work so fulfilling.

I grew up on a very successful produce and dairy farm in Southeastern Massachusetts.  Our main cash crop was tomatoes but we raised all kinds of vegetables.  They were trucked into Boston.  In the winter the dairy supported us.  My childhood exposed me to hard work but also to a love for the outdoors and nature.

Out of college I worked for the Department of Defense as a teacher in their overseas dependents' schools.  I taught in Istanbul and Seville, Spain.  I was able to travel extensively through Europe for three years.

Upon returning to the States I began teaching in Quincy, Massachusetts, where I remained for thirty years.  The last seven years were spent as a principal of an elementary school which has a majority population of Asian students.  I traveled to China one summer to explore my students' heritage and culture.

In the interim I married Joyce Brothers.  Joyce is a case manager for Boston Senior Home Care.  Her passion is cooking and she is a graduate of the Cambridge School of Culinary Arts.

She and I have raised two children.  Our daughter is a school teacher.  Our son, born in Brazil, is a hair stylist.
