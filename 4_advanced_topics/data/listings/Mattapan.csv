The living room has a box of workout gear because she's working towards optimal health in eating, exercise, and emotional/spiritual well-being.  She loves to meet new people, and have a wide appreciation for the arts.  She grew up playing piano, violin and singing, but now she only sings in the shower on occasion (not too loud though, no worries).  An interesting fact: She lived in a mud hut in Zambia for two years and in Lusaka the capital for one year while serving in the Peace Corps.  She has pictures hanging around the house that reflect some of the great relationships she built while there.

Kwame is a teacher within the Boston Public School District and has been teaching for six years. He currently teaches 7th & 8th Grade Math. He is a big karaoke fan, hence the Karaoke machine in the living room (which you might have an opportunity to try out during your visit).  He loves sports; the Red Sox is his favorite baseball team.  He enjoys jogging around the neighborhood for a good workout.   An interesting fact: He lived in Ghana for 3 years where he attended school before returning to the US for high school and college.
