Also, it is an old house so it is easy to hear the front door opening and closing, people going up and down the stairs, the neighbors if they are in the backyard, and my upstairs neighbor when she vacuums or occasionally hammers god-knows-what upstairs","Please remember that I am a single mom, and that this is home sharing! Think of it more as...staying with a friend...and not in a hotel. :) I will keep the place picked up, but just note that there may be stacks of books, kids toys, and occasional other things laying around. There might also be an occasional wondering bug, since, being an old house, everything doesn't seal as neatly as it did when it was first built. If I do see a moth or something I will remove it...or the cats will. I have two indoor only cats in the house, so if you have allergies or dislike animals, this is probably not the place for you. They tend to shed quite a bit when it is hot. One of them is old and pretty much just sleeps all day. The other is a 20lbs two-year-old gray tabby who craves attention.

I want to thank so many of you who wrote on April 15.

Although I'm usually at The Finish Line on Boylston St near Dartmouth, this year I was at Home Depot picking up the final materials and fixtures for finishing up Project 158. 

And this Tuesday April 16 morning...   I couldn't sleep, I woke, wrote, went back to bed, got up again, and wrote some more. 

 I'm writing from Boston's Historic South End, it's 4:45am birds are beginning to sing. Sirens can be heard in the distance now. I live eight brief minutes on foot from the Marathon's Finish Line. I'm still in shock. Very sad and very angry that this could happen. Especially in this city, one of the most peaceful and progressive in the country.... happen in front of our library, the first public library in the country during a ""people's sporting event"". We are a city with many ""sport's palaces"" but this event is for the every citizen. It's not dominated by high salaries and expensive admission. It's a free event here in a city that so often makes history and writes laws that have extended social justice, rights, and freedoms to so many of us. We were the first Common Wealth and our constitution was the model for The United States Constitution which has extended rights and freedoms to so many. A constitution whose rights and freedoms are too easily limited by cynical people who sow fear and hate.
Now it's 7:24 am.. more sirens, the trash truck is trashing out back, the helicopters are again in the air, the streets are empty. Last night walking home from Foodies with salad-to-go, the few who were out walked in silence, the restaurants were closed. I'm in tears. I’m looking at my (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) cover photo singing with (URL HIDDEN) last March.

Our December 14 concert fades in. It was just after the senseless deaths of NewTown CT school children. Reuben, our director, introduced us singing Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah and I don't remember his exact words but they went something like... ""Today people asked me how we could be singing at a time like this, and I said HOW COULD WE NOT BE SINGING, singing Hallelujah. Cohen's, Hallelujah, a song of praise. A song that has more than 100 verses."" He went on. ""A song that needs so many verses because Cohen's asking... ASKING how do I sing praise... how do I sing Hallelujah."" 

Reuben's words stopped and our singing began, and when our singing stopped Jordon Hall rose in a standing ovation. It's was a moment I'll never forget, a Dec 14 moment, a day I'll never forget. I don't remember Reuben's exact words, and yet, I can rebuild what he said as the thought and the moment will never leave me. 

And now one day and four months later, in the middle of the month, on a day we celebrate our Patriot's, a holiday, a holy day, here in Massachusetts, in my city, my hometown, on the 17th century streets, streets I've walked countless times, there's more sudden senseless death. 

This time let's not use this sacred time as an excuse to start wars-for-profit. Here in Massachusetts we have the will to change our sadness, our loss, out anger into a social movement. Let us begin, and let us begin by singing, singing Hallelujahs.

I'm a 29 yr old female professional living the single city life in the Beacon Hill area of Boston, MA. I feel pretty lucky to be able to live in such an incredibly diverse area with so many opportunities for adventures! 
Things I love: running the Charles River Esplanade in the mornings, exploring the menagerie of bars/restaurants/venues that are literally within walking distance, beachin' it in the summer and sledding the streets of Beacon Hill on makeshift sleds when the snow storms roll in and stop the world from turning :). 
I've got a wicked case of wanderlust so travel quite a bit-- and I figured why not share my cute little bachelorette pad with the masses while I'm gone? 
I'm pretty new to this whole AirBnB thing, but I'm excited to be apart of this cool little community-- feel free to ask me any questions! I love meeting other travellers and helping them get to know this incredible city-- so if you need recommendations on dining/bars/activities or really anything, feel free to ask! I've spent the better part of the last 3 years educating myself on the best that Boston has to offer. :)

I started on Airbnb with our Cape Cod property in May 2015 and then listed this newly renovated Boston property on August 1 after a year long building process! 

I have been successfully renting the Cape Cod home for over 10 years and have wonderful reviews on the We Need A Vacation website (id# 7281). Also,  I was a landlord before we converted to condos here in Boston for 10 years prior to that.

I promise you I am extremely accommodating to all of my guests. I make sure everything is perfect on arrival and I am accessible whenever needed. In fact, we received Superhost status on October 1st and again on January 1st of this year!

Aside from hosting, I am an advertising executive in Boston, wife to David, my partner in life and all things real state and mother to our wonderful daughter, Adria, who is in her senior year of high school and off to Chicago to attend Northwestern in the Fall.

I am enjoying meeting new and interesting people from around the world through Airbnb and making sure I provide the highest quality experience possible for all of my guests.

Thank you for taking the time to view my listings and hope to hear from you!

Warmest regards

Sue

Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That's what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. 
Just like all of the travelers that I've hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you're looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. 
Speaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it's just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!
What keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them.

I grew up in York Maine and really can't stand tourists.    I still live in Maine.  I have a very nice home within walking distances of two beaches in maine, so I plan on using airbnb to rent that out so I avoid the tourists.

I don't watch TV, so I don't need cable or anything, but I do try to play my guitar or ukulele for 15 mins every day.  Its quiet though.  Other than that, I never travel anywhere without a Gym or Yoga studio nearby.

A little bit about myself and my home:

I am an entrepreneur in my late 20s working on a marketing company. I grow up in Brookline, MA and lived in Boston for most of my life. People who meet me usually take note of my love of helping people.  All my family and friends know I am the ""go to"" if they are in a jam, need advice or if the just need to hang out and have a good time. 

I started hosting on Air B&B December 2012 at my previous home.  I recently moved into a new house in August 2013.  I loved my first experience hosting throw Air B&B so much i decided to continue hosting in my new home.  In my new house I have taken hosting to a new level.  Firstly I used my extensive knowledge of Boston to find a home in the most perfect location for all travelers.  Once I found the perfect location I then focused my attention to providing a splendid stay.  I panted every room, brought beautiful furniture, plants, paintings and so much more.  My mission is to provide all of my wonderful guests with a hotel experience while still staying true to the bargain and homey feel of a B&B.  I always strive for perfection and I constantly look for ways of improving my home for my guests.  

I am a true Boston native lived here my hole life.  I know everything Boston so if you have any questions ask away!  I am a big sports fan on Sundays you will find me watching football and everyone is always welcome to join.  I love all kinds of food, which may stem from huge diverse family.  I love working out, running, biking, swimming, yoga and playing sports.  Boston is a very young city and because of that I need to keep myself fit and young in order to keep up with the city.  I love to travel I have been all over the world.  I enjoy camping, grilling, hiking... anything and everything outside.

What helps me the most with hosting is my love for people.   Having the ability to provide my guests with a amazing stay in Boston is my #1 goal.

A little bit about myself and my home:

I am an entrepreneur in my late 20s working on a marketing company. I grow up in Brookline, MA and lived in Boston for most of my life. People who meet me usually take note of my love of helping people.  All my family and friends know I am the ""go to"" if they are in a jam, need advice or if the just need to hang out and have a good time. 

I started hosting on Air B&B December 2012 at my previous home.  I recently moved into a new house in August 2013.  I loved my first experience hosting throw Air B&B so much i decided to continue hosting in my new home.  In my new house I have taken hosting to a new level.  Firstly I used my extensive knowledge of Boston to find a home in the most perfect location for all travelers.  Once I found the perfect location I then focused my attention to providing a splendid stay.  I panted every room, brought beautiful furniture, plants, paintings and so much more.  My mission is to provide all of my wonderful guests with a hotel experience while still staying true to the bargain and homey feel of a B&B.  I always strive for perfection and I constantly look for ways of improving my home for my guests.  

I am a true Boston native lived here my hole life.  I know everything Boston so if you have any questions ask away!  I am a big sports fan on Sundays you will find me watching football and everyone is always welcome to join.  I love all kinds of food, which may stem from huge diverse family.  I love working out, running, biking, swimming, yoga and playing sports.  Boston is a very young city and because of that I need to keep myself fit and young in order to keep up with the city.

A little bit about myself and my home:

I am an entrepreneur in my late 20s working on a marketing company. I grow up in Brookline, MA and lived in Boston for most of my life. People who meet me usually take note of my love of helping people.  All my family and friends know I am the ""go to"" if they are in a jam, need advice or if the just need to hang out and have a good time. 

I started hosting on Air B&B December 2012 at my previous home.  I recently moved into a new house in August 2013.  I loved my first experience hosting throw Air B&B so much i decided to continue hosting in my new home.  In my new house I have taken hosting to a new level.  Firstly I used my extensive knowledge of Boston to find a home in the most perfect location for all travelers.  Once I found the perfect location I then focused my attention to providing a splendid stay.  I panted every room, brought beautiful furniture, plants, paintings and so much more.  My mission is to provide all of my wonderful guests with a hotel experience while still staying true to the bargain and homey feel of a B&B.  I always strive for perfection and I constantly look for ways of improving my home for my guests.  

I am a true Boston native lived here my hole life.  I know everything Boston so if you have any questions ask away!  I am a big sports fan on Sundays you will find me watching football and everyone is always welcome to join.  I love all kinds of food, which may stem from huge diverse family.  I love working out, running, biking, swimming, yoga and playing sports.  Boston is a very young city and because of that I need to keep myself fit and young in order to keep up with the city.  I love to travel I have been all over the world.  I enjoy camping, grilling, hiking... anything and everything outside.

I am a big sports fan on Sundays you will find me watching football and everyone is always welcome to join.  I love all kinds of food, which may stem from huge diverse family.  I love working out, running, biking, swimming, yoga and playing sports.  Boston is a very young city and because of that I need to keep myself fit and young in order to keep up with the city.  I love to travel I have been all over the world.  I enjoy camping, grilling, hiking... anything and everything outside.

What helps me the most with hosting is my love for people.   Having the ability to provide my guests with a amazing stay in Boston is my #1 goal.
