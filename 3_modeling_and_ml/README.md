# Overview

This session is on modeling and machine learning in R.  We will cover all steps of the  machine learning pipeline in R, which includes:

1. Data Wrangling
2. Basic Missing Data Imputation
3. Model Fitting and Tuning
4. Model Evaluation and Visualization

In the first part, we will build some predictive models using the Airbnb data set, including Linear Regression, LASSO, Logistic Regression, and CART models.  In the second part, we will go over techniques for Natural Language Processing and Unsupervised Learning using Bag-of-Words and k-means clustering.  

# Before the Session

## Project Preparation

Working with your project team, use the tools you learned in Session 2 to produce a simple R Markdown report (optionally as a dashboard). Include at least two visualizations and at least one summary table related to your data set. For each, include at least one sentence describing what makes the figure interesting and relevant. Turn in your report as a .html file on Stellar. 

Each team member should submit a report. It is acceptable for each of you to submit the same table and figures; however, **we strongly recommend that each of you type out the code individually** (rather than copy/paste or turning in multiple copies of the same file). 

## Technical Preparation

First, `git pull` to ensure that you have the most up-to-date versions of all of the files for this course.  The pre-lecture assignment for this session is **pre_lecture_assignment.R**.  Please open the file, install the R packages there which are not already installed on your computer, and double-check that you obtain the same output as in **output-1.png** and **output-2.png**.

**Upload a screenshot of your final R Console to Stellar.**

If you have any questions loading the required software, feel free to contact Zach (zblanks@mit.edu).
